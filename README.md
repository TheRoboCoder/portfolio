## Projects

### Design of an external vision system for an industrial Fanuc 6 DOF Robotic Arm.  (_April 2024_)
#### Python, OpenCV, TCP/IP protocol, Perception data acquisition, Fanuc RoboGuide Simulator.

I had the opportunity to develop a customized vision system to automate the routine of a Fanuc M-10iA industrial robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom. I created a human-machine interface using the Custom Tkinter and OpenCV libraries to build the application frame, and the socket library to establish real-time communication with the robot's PLC computer. Additionally, I programmed in Karel (Fanuc's robotic arms language) to receive commands from the external Python application via the TCP/IP protocol. The final routine was tested in both, Fanuc's simulator and real robot execution.

### Simulation of Mobile Robots and Manipulator using ROS2 on Windows Subsystem for Linux  (March 2024_)
#### ROS2, Python, C++, OpenCV, Gazebo Classic, SolidWorks.

During my eighth semester, I took a course where I acquired foundational knowledge of ROS2, including the creation of nodes, topics, and xacro files to simulate virtual environments in the Gazebo Classic simulator. I developed this project using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which provided a versatile environment for working with ROS2. I simulated two types of mobile robots: one with differential kinematics and another with an omni-wheel configuration. Additionally, I integrated a 3 DOF manipulator on one of the mobile robots to implement various plugins for controlling position and velocity parameters. I also utilized the OpenCV bridge library to incorporate artificial vision functionalities into the simulation.

### Bionic Prosthesis Hand.  (_February 2024_)
#### SolidWorks, C++, MatLAB, PCB Prototyping.

During my seventh semester, I developed a prosthetic hand from scratch based on the dimensions of my own hand, using servo motors and a gear reduction system to increase torque. I collaborated with a team of Biomedical Engineering students to design a printed circuit board capable of effectively reading and filtering myoelectrical signals from the human muscular system. Using an ESP32-S3 embedded system, I coded a digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain the frequency and amplitude of the acquired signals.

### 3 DOF Parallel robotic arm with an artifical vision app. (_December 2023_)
#### Forward and Inverse Kinematics, Solidworks, Python, C++, Embedded Systems, C#, OpenCV, Fusion 360.

Design, 3D printing, assembly, and coding of a 3 DOF parallel robot arm and a conveyor belt palletizer system. This system includes an artificial vision application for quality control, distinguishing between two types of objects. The printed circuit board (PCB) was designed from scratch with a modular approach, allowing for easy swapping of components in case of failure.

### Sumo Robot Car with PID Controller. Third Place winner of IEEE Competition.  (_August 2023_)
#### Perception data acquisition, PID, Solidworks, C++, CNC, Embedded Systems.

Design, CNC milling, laser cutting, 3D printing, assembly, and coding of an autonomous battle sumo robot car, which won third place at the state-level university competition in Aguascalientes in 2023, organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Utilizing TOF sensor technology, IMU readings from a gyroscope, and a PID controller (Proportional, Derivative and Integral parameters), the robot achieved the desired response to detect presence within a specified radius, enabling it to move effectively and quickly toward its target. Later, this robot was reprogrammed to be an Automated Guided Vehicle to follow paths on an simulated industrial-like environment using a Fuzzy Logic Controller.

### Rehabilitation and Modernization of a University's 3D Printer Laboratory.  (_January 2023_)
#### Klipper firmware, Marlin Firmware, C++, Python, Linux, SolidWorks, Kinematics.

I was responsible for rehabilitating the University’s 3D printer laboratory, where I repaired and renovated 11 machines. These machines were from brands like Creality, MakerBot, BambuLab, Anycubic and MakerMex; all of them with different bed sizes and kinematics (most of them Cartesian and CoreXY variants). This project was part of my social service requirement as a student. During the entire semester, my daily tasks included redesigning and 3D printing new parts, as well as modifying and updating old firmware on the printers. I completely built four printers from old and spare parts, using Klipper firmware to integrate new features into the machines. I installed different type of homing sensors and switches, rewired all the electronics required in all the printers and also had to design complete machines in the SolidWorks CAD software in order to ensure dimensional accuracy of components and confirm software parameters. All of the printers were successfully repaired.
